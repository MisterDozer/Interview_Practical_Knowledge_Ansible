# Interview_Practical_Knowledge_Ansible
This repo is intended to be used as part of a workflow to deploy an environment that will be used as part of the interview process to allow candidates to express their practical knowledge of Ansible. Terraform will also be used as part of this deployment, but is not in scope as part of the interview. 

This particular version of this is for my personal use until a time which I feel it is ready to be used by others. At this point this comment can be removed.
